Author Auvarifqi Putra Diandra

## Background
A significant portion of the population faces challenges in accessing loans because they lack sufficient credit history or have none at all. Home Credit aims to enhance financial inclusion for these underserved individuals by offering a favorable and secure borrowing process. To achieve this, Home Credit utilizes alternative data sources to assess their clients' ability to repay loans. This approach helps ensure that deserving clients are not turned down for loans and that loan terms, including amount, duration, and repayment schedule, are tailored to support their success.

## Objectives
1. Identified characteristics of clients who have difficulty in repaying the loans.
2. Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict client’s repayment abilities.

## Results
1. The most important features to determine whether the client is having difficulty repaying the loan are score from external data source 2, score from external data source 3, client's age in days, days ID publish, and days registration
2. The best model to predict client’s repayment abilities is Random Forest model.
